. Prompt:
- Implement an algorithm for assigning seats within a movie theater to fulfill reservation requests. Assume the movie theater has the seating arrangement of 10 rows x 20 seats.
- Design and write a seat assignment program to maximize both customer satisfaction and customer safety. 

. Assumptions
- Reservation orders will be allocated from ascending order of the seats. In other words, the allocated reservation seat number would go from 1 to 20;
- All the seats have to be utilize in order to maximine the occupation of the theater. In othter words, the seats from each row will be allocated as many as possile.
- User cannot reserve more than 20 seats at a time.

. Program running and compiling instructions:
- Prerequisite: must have JDK on running system
- Get to github page and download the source code
- Unzip the file
- Open terminal window at src folder
- For test file:
  + run javac test.java
  + run java test
  + The command will ask for input reservation
- For solution file:
  + run javac main.java
  + runa java main
  + The console will ask for input of the file path
  + The console will generate the full file path of the output file
